Debugging exercises for AIE

Download the program by clicking [here,](https://github.com/charlie-flynn/DebugDungeon/releases) then clicking on the DebugDungeon_V1.1.zip file at the top of the Assets list to download it!

Now that the file is downloaded, go into your Downloads folder to find DebugDungeon_V1.1.zip. Right-click the file, then click "Extract All".

Afterwards, open the newly extracted folder, and double-click the file named HelloDungeon.exe to run the program!

I do highly recommend clicking on the file named README.txt, located in the same folder. It contains some useful information about the program that is a little more in-depth than this file!

# HelloDungeon

Debug the program so that it runs as intended. Included is a builds folder with a folder called "v1.1". Inside is the executable to use as a reference.
There is also a reference build on the release page: https://github.com/LodisAIE/DebugDungeon/releases/tag/v1.0
